Hi, I'm Varshini. I am a third year Bioengineering student with a focus in Data Science at the University of Washington.
I am largely interested in creating and improving medical technologies that can help advance healthcare and
improving healthcare access but I also have a passion for innovating technology and contributing improvements
to advancements in other areas such as manufacturing and social justice through the application of data and
software-driven approaches. I enjoy that data science and software engineering can help make a positive
difference via data analytics, machine learning, statistical modeling, and software development and am looking
to further explore and refine these skills.
